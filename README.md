# The Pipeline

## What is this?

This is a monorepo for and hobby/demo/template project combining a bunch of my favorite tech for a smooth CI-experience.

The tools:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for Infra as Code
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for pipeline
- AWS for back-end infra (RDS, Lambda etc)

- (TBA) [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for testing. Running in a per-pipeline instance for the relevant infra.
